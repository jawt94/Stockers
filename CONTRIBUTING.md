Pull request workflow
* Always create a new branch when working on a new feature
* Push to your branch on origin
* Submit pull request and tag contributors

Code review workflow
* Someone on your team (back-end or front-end) will review the code
* Being merging the pull request, speak in person
* If there are merge conflicts, resolve them together
